          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is <span>Kenjy</span>, and I am a Full-Stack Developer based in California. I have a deep passion for problem-solving, coding, and leveraging technology to build impactful
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests continuously evolve with my environment, and currently, I am particularly fascinated by <span>Next.js</span>. I thrive on learning new technologies and frameworks, always
            seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and stay ahead in the ever-changing tech landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a highly motivated and fast learner, always driven by clear goals. Collaborating with like-minded, passionate developers inspires me to push boundaries, ask insightful questions, and
            continuously refine my craft. I take pride in my ability to <span>adapt</span> quickly, <span>improve</span> processes, and <span>deliver</span> high-quality work on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond just coding, I have a strong appreciation for <span>communication</span>, <span>mentorship</span>, and building meaningful <span>relationships</span>. I am a firm believer in
            teamwork, fostering a positive work culture, and encouraging innovation within any environment.
          </p>
          <p>Outside of technology, I enjoy rock climbing, camping, and exploring live music. I am also an avid gamer with a deep interest in FPS, MMORPGs, and TCG/Board Games.</p>
