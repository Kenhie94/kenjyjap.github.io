      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is <span>Kenjy</span>, a Fullstack Developer based in California. I'm a passionate developer with a love for problem solving, coding, and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests change greatly depending on my environment, but at the moment, I'm very interested by <span>Next JS</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new subjects and languages. I'm exceptionally a fast learner and extremely motivated when there's a goal insight. Working with other passionate developers fuels me to keep
        going. Asking questions, constantly improving, and deliver on time.
      </p>
      <p>My love for tech goes beyond just coding. I enjoy communicating, teaching, and building relationship with people. I'm very team moviated and always looking to improve moral.</p>
      <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy going rock climbing/camping, listening/discovering live music, and traveling. I also am an avid gamer playing FPS, MMORPG, and TCG/Board Games.</p>
